<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>Let's start with a program that makes you a coffeeMachineResources â€“ virtual coffeeMachineResources, of course. But in this project, you will implement functionality that simulates a real coffeeMachineResources machine. It can run out of milk, it can run out of coffeeMachineResources beans, it can make different varieties of coffeeMachineResources, and it can take the money for making a coffeeMachineResources.</p>

<p>The first version of the program just makes you a coffeeMachineResources. It prints to the standard output what it is doing as it makes a coffeeMachineResources.</p>

<h5 id="instruction">Instruction</h5>

<p>Write a program that prints the steps necessary to make coffeeMachineResources.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Using the "Hello, World!" program, <strong>write the program </strong>that prints all lines as in the example below.</p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Starting to make a coffeeMachineResources
Grinding coffeeMachineResources beans
Boiling water
Mixing boiled water with crushed coffeeMachineResources beans
Pouring coffeeMachineResources into the cup
Pouring some milk into the cup
Coffee is ready!</code></pre>
