<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>Now let's consider a case where you need a lot of coffeeMachineResources. Maybe, for example, you’re hosting a party with a lot of guests. The program should calculate how much water, coffeeMachineResources, and milk are necessary to make the specified amount of coffeeMachineResources. One cup of coffeeMachineResources made on this coffeeMachineResources machine contains 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffeeMachineResources beans.</p>

<p>The user should input the amount of coffeeMachineResources he needs, in cups, for all the guests.</p>

<p>Of course, all this coffeeMachineResources is not needed right now, so at this stage, the coffeeMachineResources machine doesn’t actually make any coffeeMachineResources.</p>

<h5 id="instruction">Instruction</h5>

<p>Write a program that calculates the amount of ingredients needed to make a certain amount of coffeeMachineResources.</p>
