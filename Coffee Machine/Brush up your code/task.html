<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>Let's redesign our program and write a class that represents the coffeeMachineResources machine. The class should have a method that takes a string as input. Every time the user inputs a line (a string) to the console, the program invokes this method with one argument: the line that user input to the console. This system simulates pretty accurately how real-world electronic devices work. External components (like buttons on the coffeeMachineResources machine or tapping on the screen) generate events that pass into the single interface of the program.</p>

<p>The class should not use system input at all; it only should handle input that comes to it via this method and its string argument.</p>

<p>The first problem that comes to mind: how to write that method in a way that it represents all that coffeeMachineResources machine can do? If the user inputs a single number, how can the method determine what that number is: a variant of coffeeMachineResources chosen by the user or the number of the disposable cups that a special worker added into the coffeeMachineResources machine?</p>

<p>The right solution to this problem is to store the current state of the machine. The coffeeMachineResources machine has several states it can be in. For example, the state could be "choosing an action" or "choosing a variant of coffeeMachineResources". Every time the user inputs something and a program passes that line to the method, the program determines how to interpret this line using the information about the current state. After processing this line, the state of the coffeeMachineResources machine can be changed or can stay the same. The most efficient way of handling states is using an enum with all predefined states.</p>

<p>Remember, that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the espresso, the coffeeMachineResources machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffeeMachineResources beans. It costs $4.</li>
	<li>For the latte, the coffeeMachineResources machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffeeMachineResources beans. It costs $7.</li>
	<li>And for the cappuccino, the coffeeMachineResources machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffeeMachineResources. It costs $6.</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="instruction">Instruction</h5>

<p>Refactor the program. Make it so that you can communicate with the coffeeMachineResources machine through a single method.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Your coffeeMachineResources machine should have the same initial resources as in the example (400 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffeeMachineResources beans, 9 disposable cups, $550 in cash).<br>
The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
