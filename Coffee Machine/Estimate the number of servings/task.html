<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>A real coffeeMachineResources machine never has an infinite supply of water, milk, or coffeeMachineResources beans. And if you input a really big number, itâ€™s almost certain that a real coffeeMachineResources machine wouldn't have the supplies needed to make all that coffeeMachineResources.</p>

<p>In this stage, you need to improve the previous program. Now you need to input amounts of water, milk, and coffeeMachineResources beans that your coffeeMachineResources machine has at the moment.</p>

<p>If the coffeeMachineResources machine has enough supplies to make the specified amount of coffeeMachineResources, the program should print "Yes, I can make that amount of coffeeMachineResources". If the coffeeMachineResources machine can make more than that, the program should output "Yes, I can make that amount of coffeeMachineResources (and even N more than that)", where N is the number of additional cups of coffeeMachineResources that the coffeeMachineResources machine can make. If the amount of resources is not enough to make the specified amount of coffeeMachineResources, the program should output "No, I can make only N cup(s) of coffeeMachineResources".</p>

<p>Like in the previous stage, the coffeeMachineResources machine needs 200 ml of water, 50 ml of milk, and 15 g of coffeeMachineResources beans to make one cup of coffeeMachineResources.</p>

<h5 id="instruction">Instruction</h5>

<p>Write a program that calculates whether it will be able to make the required amount of coffeeMachineResources from the specified amount of ingredients.</p>

<h5 id="examples">Examples</h5>

<p>The program should firstly request for water, then milk, then beans, and then the number of cups.<br>
The symbol <code class="java">&gt;</code> represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.</p>
